<h1>Numerical Analysis</h1>
<p>
   This repository contains a collection of numerical analysis algorithms implemented in Python.<br>
   The algorithms cover a wide range of topics in numerical analysis including:<br>
   Equation system, integration, interpolation, finite arithmetic, root-finding.<br>
   The repository is implemented without the use of any external libraries or modules (hard-coded)
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To build and run this project, you need to have the following tools installed</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Python 3.x</li>
   <li>Python IDE</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
   <li>
      Clone or download the repository to your local machine
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Nitzantomer1998/NumericalAnalysis.git</code></pre>
  </li>
   <li>Open the project in your preferred IDE</li>
   <li>Import the desired algorithm and use it in your project</li>
</ol>

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Equation System: Gauss Seidel, Inverse Matrix, Jacobi, LU Decomposition, Successive Over Relaxation</li>
   <li>Integration: Romberg, Simpson, Trapezoidal</li>
